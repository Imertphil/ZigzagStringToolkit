# ZigzagStringToolkit
***This toolkit helps you encode, decode, and generate reversed zigzag strings! :D***

This project was inspired by *LeetCode Question 6: Zigzag Conversion*.
Link: [(https://leetcode.com/problems/zigzag-conversion/description/)]

I was wondering if I could create a function that generates a reversed_encoded_zigzag string, which can be converted back into its original readable format when encoded with the same row number.

And guess what? I did it! :D

As a bonus, I also create a function that can decode a normal_encoded_zigzag string using the right row number!

The encode function is included in the same file as zigzag_encode_reverse.
